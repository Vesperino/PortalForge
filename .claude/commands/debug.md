description: Help debug an issue by analyzing logs, code, and potential causes
---

I'm experiencing an issue. Please help me debug it by:

1. **Gather Information**:
   - Ask me to describe the issue and symptoms
   - Request relevant error messages or logs
   - Ask about when the issue started occurring
   - Understand what was changed recently

2. **Analyze**:
   - Review relevant code files
   - Check for common issues based on the tech stack
   - Look for potential race conditions, null references, etc.
   - Consider configuration issues

3. **Investigate**:
   - Backend: Check API logs, database queries, exceptions
   - Frontend: Check browser console, network requests, component state
   - Integration: Check API contracts, CORS, authentication

4. **Propose Solutions**:
   - List potential root causes (ordered by likelihood)
   - Suggest diagnostic steps to confirm the cause
   - Provide fix recommendations
   - Include code examples for fixes

5. **Prevent Recurrence**:
   - Suggest tests to catch this issue
   - Recommend monitoring or logging improvements
   - Document the issue and solution in `.ai/decisions/`

Ask me questions to start the debugging process.
