description: Update project documentation after completing a feature or making significant changes
---

Please update the project documentation in the `.ai/` folder to reflect recent changes:

1. Review what was changed in this session
2. Update relevant documentation files in `.ai/backend/` or `.ai/frontend/`
3. Create a new progress log entry in `.ai/progress/` with today's date
4. Update CLAUDE.md if project structure or key technologies changed
5. Document any architectural decisions in `.ai/decisions/` if applicable
6. Ensure all changes are clear and well-documented for future sessions

Focus on:
- What was implemented
- Why decisions were made
- Any blockers or technical debt
- Next steps
